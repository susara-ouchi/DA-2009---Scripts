5,"Notes: Alan Davidson (Australia), in the tied 1st Test at Brisbane against the West Indies in 1960–61, was the first man to score 100 runs and take 10 wickets in a match (and is the only other player to achieve this so far), but without a century: his two scores with the bat were 44 and 80, in addition to 11 wickets (5/135 and 6/87). Betty Wilson was the first player to do it in 1958. She scored 100 and was 11/18. Enid Bakewell made this milestone the year before Botham.[106]","Notes: Alan Davidson (Australia), in the tied 1st Test at Brisbane against the West Indies in 1960–61, was the first man to score 100 runs and take 10 wickets in a match (and is the only other player to achieve this so far), but without a century: his two scores with the bat were 44 and 80, in addition to 11 wickets (5/135 and 6/87).
